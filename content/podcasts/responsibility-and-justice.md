If two people have a medical condition that requires treatment and John is responsible for having the condition, but Janet is not, then some people believe that Janet should take priority.  Janet should be treated first.  But benefiting Janet in this way only really makes sense if we are first clear what we mean by John being ‘responsible’ for his condition.  Ben Davies is a Research Fellow at the Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics.
