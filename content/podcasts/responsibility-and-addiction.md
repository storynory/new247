Normally, when we say that somebody is addicted to a substance, like a drug, we believe it is because they have lost control – they don’t have the ability to resist their desire for it – even if they at some level still believe it is harmful to them.  And to some extent, we are inclined to say, they are no longer responsible for surrendering to this desire.  But Neil Levy says science should force us to reconsider the link between control, responsibility and belief.
