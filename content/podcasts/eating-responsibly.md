bio: Becky Brown is a philosopher at Oxford’s Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics, University of Oxford. Becky’s work focuses on the ethics of health promotion, particularly questions about responsibility for unhealthy behaviour. This research involves considering how philosophical theories can be informed by evidence from the social and medical sciences and vice versa. Ultimately, the aim of this work is to better understand what kinds of approaches to encouraging healthy behaviour are justified

Suppose an obese person requires a hospital procedure for a condition that is in part linked to their obesity.  Many people might believe that a patient must bear responsibility for being overweight. And, other things being equal, that’s a reason to prioritise the needs of another patient first.  So is the concept of responsibility a useful one in determining how to distribute health resources. Becky Brown is not convinced.
