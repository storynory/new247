bio: Jon Pike is Senior Lecturer in Philosophy at the Open University. His main research interest is in the Philosophy of Sport. He is the Chair of the British Philosophy of Sport Association. He is interested in Doping and anti-Doping, in what - if anything - gives sport its value, and in how far a sport can change and still remain the same sport.  He is working on a monograph against conventionalism, and for a version of Aristotelianism as an account of sport.

David would like to have become a professional basketball player, and played in the US basketball league, the NBA.  There were just a few things holding him back.  He lacked the physique and strength, the speed and athleticism, the skill and coordination.  But apart from that… Jon Pike is a philosopher of sport.   David Edmonds spoke to him about not having a basketball career – and about whether men and women should compete separately in sport.
