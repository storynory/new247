bio: Dr. Avia Pasternak is a lecturer in global ethics at University College London,  where she is also the programme director of the MSc in Ethics and Global Governance. She works in the area of political theory and global justice. Her primary research interest is collective agency and collective responsibility. She has published works on the distribution of collective responsibility in the state, the collective agency of democratic publics, the permissibility of international economic sanctions, and on collective punishment. She is currently working on a manuscript on the collective agency and responsibility of states, which will defy current international practices that assign collective agency and responsibility to all states, regardless of their internal structure and regime.

Philosophers have justified wars - so why not justify the much lower level violence of a riot?  If people have a just cause, why should they not retaliate against public property?  Perhaps a racial minority  has suffered violent discrimination -  a riot might be the most viable way to draw attention to their plight.  Avia Pasternak argues that a riot can be "proportional" and that we should judge rioters in the light of their cause.
