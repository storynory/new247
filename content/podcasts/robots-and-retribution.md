You read about a judge jailing the offender of a particularly heinous crime - and you feel, what, well, probably some satisfaction.  Justice has been done.  The culprit will suffer.  He deserves it.  Retribution is satisfying.  But in the future this feeling may be hard to quench.  Robots are now being programmed to learn: among other things, that means that we can’t always predict how they will act.
