Female circumcision is regarded as a violation of a human right. The World Health Organisation says “It reflects deep-rooted inequality between the sexes, and constitutes an extreme form of discrimination against women.” But male circumcision, practiced in various cultures and prevalent in various religions, barely generates any controversy.  Brian Earp argues that the parallels between the two are much closer than people are usually willing to acknowledge.
