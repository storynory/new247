Machines are becoming smarter and smarter.  And it’s quite possible that within a generation or two we’ll reach the era of what Nick Bostrom calls superintelligence.  That means, he says, we’re currently living through a unique period – a period of unparalleled significance for our future.

 Nick Bostrom's warmings about Humanity's ability to keep pace with super intelligent machines are getting noticed in high places. He was recently mentioned in <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/10president-obama-mit-joi-ito-interview/">a conversation with President Obama</a> and you can read more about him in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/12/nick-bostrom-artificial-intelligence-machine">this Guardian interview.</a>

He is the author of the best selling book, Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies. You can find his books on <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nick-Bostrom/e/B001HCZVL8/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1">Amazon.co.uk and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nick-Bostrom/e/B001HCZVL8/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1"> Amazon.com</a>
