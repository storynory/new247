You really don’t need to listen to this podcast.  I don’t care one way or the other.  I’m completely indifferent, honestly.  Because I’m not passive–aggressive.  Not at all.  But what is passive-aggression, and why is it objectionable.  Rebecca Roache has been taking a cool-headed appraisal of passive aggression.
