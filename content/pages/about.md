Philosophy 24/7 brings you concise interviews with leading philosophers about pressing moral, political and social questions.

The podcast is hosted by David Edmonds, a multi-award-winning BBC journalist, and one half of the pair behind Philosophy Bites.

David has written several acclaimed books on two of his passions: philosophy and chess. His first book, Wittgenstein’s Poker, became an international bestseller. His recent works include Would You Kill the Fat Man? and Philosophers Take On The World. The The Wall Street Journal described him as “a marvel of economy and learning worn lightly.”

He is a senior research associate at the University of Oxford’s Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics, and a Senior Research Associate at the Institute of Philosophy.
