<p>If I see a woman drowning in a pond, I have an obligation to do something to help. If she’d fallen into the pond after I’d bumped into her, my obligation might be all the greater. We tend to think of bystanders having obligations - and culprits of course too. But the issue of whether victims also have obligations – and what they might be - is not typically discussed.  Ashwini Vasanthakumar is at King’s College London. </p>
