  Dr. Avia Pasternak is a lecturer in global ethics at University College London,  where she is also the programme director of the MSc in Ethics and Global Governance. She works in the area of political theory and global justice. Her primary research interest
  is collective agency and collective responsibility. She has published works on the distribution of collective responsibility in the state, the collective agency of
  democratic publics, the permissibility of international economic sanctions, and on collective punishment. She is currently working on a manuscript on the collective
  agency and responsibility of states, which will defy current international practices that assign collective agency and responsibility to all states, regardless of their
  internal structure and regime.
