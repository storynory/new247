Do you deserve to be commemorated after your death? Do you want to be commemorated? Perhaps you’d like a memorial like the Lincoln Memorial in Washington. Does it make any difference to you whether or not you’ll be commemorated – after all, you won’t be around to experience it? Zofia Stemplowska is a political theorist at Worcester College Oxford – and is researching the ethics of commemoration.
