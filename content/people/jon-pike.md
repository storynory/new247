name: Jon Pike
bio: Jon Pike is Senior Lecturer in Philosophy at the Open University. His main research interest is in the Philosophy of Sport. He is the Chair of the British Philosophy of Sport Association. He is interested in Doping and anti-Doping, in what - if anything - gives sport its value, and in how far a sport can change and still remain the same sport.  He is working on a monograph against conventionalism, and for a version of Aristotelianism as an account of sport.
