Removing body hair, dying hair, buffing nails, applying make-up.  There’s nothing new about people caring about how they look.  There’s nothing new about people trying to enhance their appearance with cosmetics and other products.  What is new, according to <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/philosophy/widdows-heather.aspx
">Heather Widdows</a>, is the degree to which society expects us to pursue the beauty ideal and the pressure to conform.
